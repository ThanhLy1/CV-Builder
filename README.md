## Phase 7: Export and Sharing Features
- **Week 9:**
  - [ ] Implement PDF/Word export functionality using `react-pdf` or a similar library.
  - [ ] Allow users to share their CVs via a public link or email.
  - [ ] Implement version control for CVs, allowing users to save multiple versions.

## Phase 8: Testing and Accessibility
- **Week 10:**
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all components, including AI-driven features.
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows.
  - [ ] Ensure the application is accessible, supporting screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## Phase 9: Deployment and Optimization
